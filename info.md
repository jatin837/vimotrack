# Basic Motion detection and tracking
This project aims to create a simple motion detector and tracker using **Background subtraction**

## Assumption
**The background of our video stream is largely static and unchanging over consecutive frames of a video. Therefore, if we can model the background, we monitor it for substantial changes. If there is a substantial change, we can detect it â€” this change normally corresponds to motion on our video.**


most successful background subtraction/foreground detection systems utilize fixed mounted cameras and in controlled lighting conditions.


# How this works?
1. the very first frame is marked as **First frame**
2. we preprocess everyframe, following
	- gaussian blur
	- resize
3. we calculate absolute difference of **First frame** with **subsequent frames**
4. then, we apply thresholding technique
5. detect the contours
6. if contour size is greater or equal to min-area, the we detected some motion
