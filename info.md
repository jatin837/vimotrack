# Basic Motion detection and tracking
This project aims to create a simple motion detector and tracker using **Background subtraction**

## Assumption
**The background of our video stream is largely static and unchanging over consecutive frames of a video. Therefore, if we can model the background, we monitor it for substantial changes. If there is a substantial change, we can detect it â€” this change normally corresponds to motion on our video.**


most successful background subtraction/foreground detection systems utilize fixed mounted cameras and in controlled lighting conditions.
